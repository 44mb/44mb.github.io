Over the past week I've slowly started pulling parts off of the Jeep and trying to figure out what I have. So far I've figured out that it doesn't have a thermostat, the fuel filter was bypassed and the air filter is mostly intact and in good shape. That's a plus. I do think the engine is stuck, but I'm still soaking it in that [Marvel Mystery Oil][marvel-mystery-oil] stuff. I did drain the oil that was in there and replaced it with some cheap oil.

Parts I've removed and started to restore:

 - [Oil air filter and brackets][#14]
 - [Fuel filter (although I'm going to replace this with an inline one)][#12]
 - [The horn system][#16]
 - [The thermostat housing][#11]
 - [All of the air filter to the carburetor tubing][#17]


So, I'm getting there slowly.
