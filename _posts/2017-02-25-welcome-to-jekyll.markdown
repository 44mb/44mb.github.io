Yesterday was an adventure, to say the least. It actually started Tuesday
morning when I saw an ad on Craigslist for 2 old Jeeps. I've been looking
for one for a few years now and the prices and distance from me didn't seem
too bad. So, I called them, talked to them about he Jeeps and made plans to
head down the mountain and take a look at them. Tursday afternoon when I made
the spur of the moment decision to go down to Newton and look see what this dude
had. There was a 1948 Willys CJ-2A with a stuck engine and, what is told, a 1944
Ford GPW. 

Turns out the GPW was actually a MB-38 that isn't in that bad of shape. The
engine is mostly there, seems to move, and the frame is pretty clean. It
needs a lot of work and time put into it. I rolled it around a bit and
the differentials seemed okay. The 4 wheel stick moved back and forth and
the high/low stick seemed to work. The body needs a lot of work, it's rusted
through in some spots and it looks like someone tried to fix a bunch of the old
holes for stuff with bondo.

Getting it home was fun, I rented a trailer from U-Haul and put it on the back
of my Tacoma. We pulled it out of the barn with a tractor and used a hand wench
to get it the rest of the way up.

The drive up the mountain sucked, I did 40 pretty much the entire way until I 
got to the hilly part of 321. Then I did 20-30 the whole way up. The jeep is
pretty heavy.

Getting it off the trailer wasn't fun either. As I unstrapped it and started
to push it off the trailer, it rolled back right into a ditch and was stopped
by a tree. Good start. Then I managed to turn the trailer around and get it 
back to U-Haul and went to Lowe's to get a chain and pull it out of the ditch.

That's where we're at now. It's parked in my turn around and just hanging out.
I've taken off the headlights and started cutting wires so I can take the grill
off and deal with that.
