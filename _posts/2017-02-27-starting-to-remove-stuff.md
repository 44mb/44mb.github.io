Yesterday I spent the morning doing a few different things. Mainly I started
removing parts from the right side of the engine and trying to figure out what
exactly I have.

So far I've removed:

 - The hose that connects the Oil Bath Air Cleaner to the Carburetor
 - The part that connects the grill to the tub and keeps the radiator in place
 - The horn

I know I'm going to need to find the following:

 - An oil system
 - A carburetor rebuild kit
 - A thermostat rebuild kit
 - A starter
 - A generator
 - Wiring kit

I'm planning on taking the radiator out after work and trying to get the fan
off.

I did get the spark plugs out of it pretty easily and took a look at the tops of
the cylinders, they looked like they are in decent shape. As soon as I get the
grill and radiator off I'll be able to get the timing cover off and make sure
that's not broken.

I also discovered that the head isn't the original head from the engine, I'm kind of thinking that the whole engine and drive train are from a CJ-2A/3A. The casting numbers say it's from a CJ-2A/3A. I found some pictures of the different heads for the [L-134 engine here][l-134-heads]{:target="_blank"}.
